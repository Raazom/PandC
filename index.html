              at Vitalia so I came and spent it there with you. Our last was our first spending the entirety together and in North Carolina on top of that. This one however was
              our first that outside of work that we got to spend together (even if it was only for the end). We both had work this day and got off at close to midnight but we were
              still able to see each other and the disney fireworks behind your apartment in time to spend it together. We then went out to get wings cause that's what we do but
              most things were closed....
